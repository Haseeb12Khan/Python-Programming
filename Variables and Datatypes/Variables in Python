QUESTION
----------------------------------------------
A variable is like a labelled box where you can store data. Imagine you have a box labeled "age" and you put the number 25 in it. 
In Python, you would do this by writing:
          age = 25

When you write this, python creates a box(variable) with name age and stores 25 in that box(variable).

This process of creating a variable to store a value is called Declaration and
The process of setting its value for the first time is called Initialization.

Here's the cool part: whenever you use age in your code, Python will remember it is 25. 
For example, if you write print(age), Python will show 25.

print(age) # Output: 25

Task:
Create a variable in editor named age and assign the value 25 to it.
Print the value of age variable using print statement.
Notice how we don't use " " (double quotes) when printing variables.

SOLUTION
--------------------------------------------------
age = 25
print(age)

Your Output:
--------------------------------------------------
25
