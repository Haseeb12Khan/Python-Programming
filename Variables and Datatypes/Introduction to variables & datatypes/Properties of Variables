QUESTION
------------------------------------------------------
We learned that variable is a labelled box which can store many different types of values. You can also change the value of a variable in your code.

For example:
          age = 25
          print(age)

          # Update age
          age = 26
          print(age)

The above code will output:  25
                              26

We are going to use variables all the time in the coming lessons. So let's learn a few more stuff about them.

Rules for Python variable names:
      -> A variable name can only contain alphabets, numbers and underscores (ie. A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _).
      -> A variable name cannot start with a number.
      -> A variable name cannot have spaces in between.
      -> Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).

Be sure to follow these rules when creating a variable to not get errors.

Task:
      -> There is some code written in the editor to print Code Chef.
      -> But the variable names are not following the rule. Can you spot the mistake and fix it?

SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------
first_name = "Code"
last_name = "Chef"
print(first_name, last_name)

Your output:
-------------------------------------------------------
Code Chef
