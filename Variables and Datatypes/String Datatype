              QUESTION
            --------------------------
The string type is used to store a sequence of characters, i.e. text.
String values can be surrounded by either double quotes or single quotes.
Python does not care about whether you use single or double quotes.

For example, both the below codes do the same thing:
sentence1 = "I am using CodeChef"
sentence2 = 'I am using CodeChef'

Task:  Write a program which does the following:
          Declare two variables a and b
          Assign Learning to a and is fun! to b

Using the concepts we learned previously, display the sentence "Learning is fun!" using variables a and b in a single line

              SOLUTION
          --------------------------------------
a = 'Learning'
b = 'is fun!'
print(a + " " + b);
