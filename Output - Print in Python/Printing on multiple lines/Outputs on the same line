QUESTION
-------------------------------------------
We can print multiple items by separating by commas. Python will automatically add a space between them.
          print(1, 2, 3, 4) # Output: 1 2 3 4
When you use commas to separate items inside the print() function, Python prints each item with a space in between.

Task:  Write a program which does the following.
    Output: 3 + 4
    Output: 2 + 1 on the same line

Note how the numbers are space separated.

SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------
print(3 + 4, 2 + 1)

Your output:
-----------------------------------------------
7  3
